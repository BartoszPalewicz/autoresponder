    Hi,<br/><br/>
    
    thanks for your email.<br/>
    <b>Whatâ€™s the best number to reach you?</b><br/>
    So that we can discuss your idea in detail.<br/><br/>

    Couple of words about me:<br/>
    I run a <b>software agency here in the US.<b/> I focus on mobile & web apps, as well as complex back-end systems. I have experience with JavaScript, Node, React, and Python, and contract mostly for clients from NYC and SF.<br/><br/>

    Some of my most recent projects:<br/>
    <b>-AT&T<b/><br/>
    A corporate system for AT&T in the US for event management.<br/>
    Designs were secondary; it was the logic, security, and integrations that were most important.<br/><br/>

    -https://ridecell.com/<br/>
    Car sharing platform. SF-based.<br/><br/>

    -also, I've just started a small, 300 h project for an online influencer, Parker Walbeck (https://www.parkerwalbeck.com/, https://www.fulltimefilmmaker.com) and I'm building an upwork for a creative industry (especially for filmmakers and artists).<br/><br/>

    I attach some of my testimonials.<br/>

    Looking forward to hearing from you<br/>
